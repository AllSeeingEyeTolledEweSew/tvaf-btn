# Design notes:

# Config is stored as json. This is so external programs can easily manipulate
# the config if necessary.

# Config is a dict of json-compatible python primitives. I tried using a
# dataclass to map it, but as of 3.8, translating between dataclasses and json
# is still quite cumbersome. We either need ad-hoc code in several different
# places, or complex metaclass code. All type conversion also needs to be
# centralized, which impacts modularity.

# Config updates are "staged" such that e.g. when the HTTP port is changed, we:
#  - bind a socket to the new port
#  - attempt any other config changes
#  - if other changes fail, close the new socket
#  - if other changes succeed, start the server on the new port and close
#    the old server.
# This makes certain changes impossible, such as changing the binding from
# 0.0.0.0:21 to 127.0.0.1:21, as the old server breaks the new binding. However
# I notice that nginx has the same limitation, so it's probably good enough.

# In Python we prefer to work with "disposable" objects which are configured
# only once, and re-created as necessary. However, tvaf's top-level App code
# doesn't know the right life cycle for its various components (for example,
# should the App re-create the server for a particular config change?).
# So we design our components to be long-lived objects which can be
# re-configured over their lifetimes.
